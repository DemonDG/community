# Open FIP0036 FIL Poll

**Background**
The purpose of this poll is to determine community consensus to accept or reject [FIP0036](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0036.md).

Discussions and further questions related to this FIP should be directed to the [active discussion thread](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/453). 

**Proposal**
* Increase minimum sector duration time from six months to 1.5 years 
* Increase the maximum sector duration time from 1.5 years to 3.5 years 
* Introduce a Sector Duration Multiplier for all sectors, regardless of deal type 
* Increase Sector Initial Consensus Pledge from 30% to 50% 

All participating community members are encouraged to review the terms of the FIP in entirety prior to casting a vote. 

**Impact**
FIP0036 intends to introduce more favorable locked value dynamics, which will contribute to overall network utility, stable circulating supply dynamics, and SP profitability and optionality.
